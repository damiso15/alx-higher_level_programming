* 0-read_file.py - Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout
* 1-write_file.py - Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written


## 0-read_file.py ##
Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout:

* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module

## 1-write_file.py ##
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written:

* Prototype: `def write_file(filename="", text=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
* Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
* Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
* You are not allowed to import any module
